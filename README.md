Skin melanoma is one of the deadliest form of skin cancer. It’s caused by skin cells that begin to develop abnormally. The melanoma usually is detected as an appearance of a new mole or change in an existing mole.

Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but it can involves also organs. It’s a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body.


Deep Learning is the state of the art for Computer vision

It has a lot of potential in the medicine of the future

In this small project we built a binary classification model a Convolutional Neural Network
